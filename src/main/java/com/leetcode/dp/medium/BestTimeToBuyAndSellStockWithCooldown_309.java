// Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock
// on day i.
//
// Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many tran
// sactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times
// ) with the following restrictions:
//
//
// You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must se
// ll the stock before you buy again).
// After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1
// day)
//
//
// Example:
//
//
// Input: [1,2,3,0,2]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
