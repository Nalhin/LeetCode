// There are 1000 buckets, one and only one of them is poisonous, while the rest
// are filled with water. They all look identical. If a pig drinks the poison it wi
// ll die within 15 minutes. What is the minimum amount of pigs you need to figure
// out which bucket is poisonous within one hour?
//
// Answer this question, and write an algorithm for the general case.
//
//
//
// General case:
//
// If there are n buckets and a pig drinking poison will die within m minutes, h
// ow many pigs (x) you need to figure out the poisonous bucket within p minutes? T
// here is exactly one bucket with poison.
//
//
//
// Note:
//
//
// A pig can be allowed to drink simultaneously on as many buckets as one would
// like, and the feeding takes no time.
// After a pig has instantly finished drinking buckets, there has to be a cool d
// own time of m minutes. During this time, only observation is allowed and no feed
// ings at all.
// Any given bucket can be sampled an infinite number of times (by an unlimited
// number of pigs).
