-- #Table: Transactions
--  #
-- #
-- #+----------------+----------+
-- #| Column Name    | Type     |
-- #+----------------+----------+
-- #| transaction_id | int      |
-- #| day            | datetime |
-- #| amount         | int      |
-- #+----------------+----------+
-- #transaction_id is the primary key for this table.
-- #Each row contains information about one transaction.
-- #
-- #
-- #
-- #
-- # Write an SQL query to report the IDs of the transactions with the maximum amou
-- #nt on their respective day. If in one day there are multiple such transactions,
-- #return all of them.
-- #
-- # Return the result table in ascending order by transaction_id.
-- #
-- # The query result format is in the following example:
-- #
-- #
-- #
-- #
-- #Transactions table:
-- #+----------------+--------------------+--------+
-- #| transaction_id | day                | amount |
-- #+----------------+--------------------+--------+
-- #| 8              | 2021-4-3 15:57:28  | 57     |
-- #| 9              | 2021-4-28 08:47:25 | 21     |
-- #| 1              | 2021-4-29 13:28:30 | 58     |
-- #| 5              | 2021-4-28 16:39:59 | 40     |
-- #| 6              | 2021-4-29 23:39:28 | 58     |
-- #+----------------+--------------------+--------+
-- #
-- #Result table:
-- #+----------------+
-- #| transaction_id |

-- #| 1              |
-- #| 5              |
-- #| 6              |
-- #| 8              |
-- #+----------------+
-- #"2021-4-3"  --> We have one transaction with ID 8, so we add 8 to the result ta
-- #ble.
-- #"2021-4-28" --> We have two transactions with IDs 5 and 9. The transaction with
-- # ID 5 has an amount of 40, while the transaction with ID 9 has an amount of 21.
-- #We only include the transaction with ID 5 as it has the maximum amount this day.
-- #
-- #"2021-4-29" --> We have two transactions with IDs 1 and 6. Both transactions ha
