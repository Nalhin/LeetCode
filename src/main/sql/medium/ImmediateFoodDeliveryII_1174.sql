-- #delivery_id is the primary key of this table.
-- #The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders a
-- #t some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or aft
-- #er it).
-- #
-- #
-- #
-- #
-- # If the preferred delivery date of the customer is the same as the order date t
-- #hen the order is called immediate otherwise it's called scheduled.
-- #
-- # The first order of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that c
-- #ustomer made. It is guaranteed that a customer has exactly one first order.
-- #
-- # Write an SQL query to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first ord
-- #ers of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.
-- #
-- # The query result format is in the following example:
