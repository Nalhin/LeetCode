-- #This table holds the data of friend acceptance, while requester_id and accepter
-- #_id both are the id of a person.

-- #
-- # Write a query to find the the people who has most friends and the most friends
-- # number under the following rules:
-- #
-- #
-- # It is guaranteed there is only 1 people having the most friends.
-- # The friend request could only been accepted once, which mean there is no multi
-- #ple records with the same requester_id and accepter_id value.
-- #
-- #
-- # For the sample data above, the result is:
-- #
-- #
-- #Result table:
-- #+------+------+
-- #| id   | num  |
-- #|------|------|
-- #| 3    | 3    |
-- #+------+------+
-- #The person with id '3' is a friend of people '1', '2' and '4', so he has 3 frie
-- #nds in total, which is the most number than any others.
-- #
-- #
-- # Follow-up:
-- #In the real world, multiple people could have the same most number of friends,
-- #can you find all these people in this case?
