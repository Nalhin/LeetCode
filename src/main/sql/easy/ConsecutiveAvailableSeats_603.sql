-- #Several friends at a cinema ticket office would like to reserve consecutive ava
-- #ilable seats.
-- #Can you help to query all the consecutive available seats order by the seat_id
-- #using the following cinema table?
--                             #
-- #| seat_id | free |
-- #|---------|------|
-- #| 1       | 1    |
-- #| 2       | 0    |
-- #| 3       | 1    |
-- #| 4       | 1    |
-- #| 5       | 1    |
-- #
-- #
-- #
-- #Your query should return the following result for the sample case above.

-- #
-- #| seat_id |
-- #|---------|
-- #| 3       |
-- #| 4       |
-- #| 5       |
-- #
-- #Note:
-- #
-- #
-- # The seat_id is an auto increment int, and free is bool ('1' means free, and '0
-- #' means occupied.).
-- # Consecutive available seats are more than 2(inclusive) seats consecutively ava
