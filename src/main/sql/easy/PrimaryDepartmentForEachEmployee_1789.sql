-- #Table: Employee
--  #
-- #
-- #+--------------+---------+
-- #| Column Name  |  Type   |
-- #+--------------+---------+
-- #| employee_id  | int     |
-- #| deprtment_id | int     |
-- #| primary_flag | varchar |
-- #+--------------+---------+
-- #(employee_id, department_id) is the primary key for this table.
-- #employee_id is the id of the employee.
-- #department_id is the id of the department to which the employee belongs.
-- #primary_flag is an ENUM of type ('Y', 'N'). If the flag is 'Y', the department
-- #is the primary department for the employee. If the flag is 'N', the department i
-- #s not the primary.
-- #
-- #
-- #
-- #
-- # Employees can belong to multiple departments. When the employee joins other de
-- #partments, they need to decide which department is their primary department. Not
-- #e that when an employee belongs to only one department, their primary column is
-- #'N'.
-- #
-- # Write an SQL query to report all the employees with their primary department.
-- #For employees who belong to one department, report their only department.
-- #
-- # Return the result table in any order.
-- #
-- # The query result format is in the following example.
